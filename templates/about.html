<p>
  I'm a third year computer science student at the University of Nottingham, the Development Secretary and
  Graphics Officer at <a href="https://hacksocnotts.co.uk">HackSoc</a>, and was a lead organiser of
  <a href="https://hacknotts.com">HackNotts 2022</a>. I'm especially interested in functional programming,
  compilers, and computer graphics - my favourite language is Haskell!</p>

  You can find a list of my (mostly unfinished) projects on <a href="https://github.com/zac-garby?tab=repositories">my GitHub.</a>
  If for some reason you want to contact me, my email is <a href="mailto:me@zacgarby.co.uk">me@zacgarby.co.uk</a>, or you can send me a message on Discord (zacg#7868).
